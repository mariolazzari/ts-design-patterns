# TypeScript Design Patterns

## Intro

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems.

- Tested soltutions
- Better comunication
- Best practices

## OOP

### Objects

OOP uses objects in order to structure and organize code.

### Abstraction

Process of simplifyng complex systems by breaking them into smaller components, by exposing only essential features to user (implementation hidding).

- class: blueprint for object creation
- interface: enforce class structure

ex: [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) 

### Encapsulation

Promotes separation of concerns and data hiding.

### Polymorphism 

It enables a single interface or method to work with different types.

- Parameters
- Generics
- Ad hoc

ex: [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)

### Inheritance

Allows to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting reusability and modularity.

## SOLID design principles

## Creational design patterns

## Structural design patterns

## Behavioural design patterns
